# Tsukuyumi - After the Moonfall TTRPG Character Builder

# Overview
This python project tries to function as easy character builder for the TTRPG "Tsukuyumi - After the Moonfall" from King Racoon Games.

This code runs as jupyter notebooks as this is hopefully easier for people not being comfortable with running python code, but it could just be run as python code.

Initially, a few lines were generated using ChatGPT and subsequently modified.
